This file provides information about using Claude with the branch project.

## About Claude

Claude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic. This project uses Claude to help visualize LLM outputs in a branching structure.

## Project Context

Branch is designed to visualize LLM outputs, making it easier to understand and explore different conversational paths and decision trees generated by language models.

## Usage with Claude

This project can be used to visualize outputs from Claude and other LLMs, helping to:
- Track different conversation branches
- Analyze decision-making paths
- Visualize response variations
- Compare different LLM outputs

## Development

For development with Claude Code:
- Use Claude Code CLI for file operations
- Follow the branching structure for organizing outputs
- Maintain clear documentation of LLM interactions

## Contributing

When contributing to this project:
1. Document any new visualization features
2. Test with various LLM outputs
3. Ensure compatibility with Claude's output formats
4. Follow the existing code structure
